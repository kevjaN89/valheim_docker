# valheim_docker
# Valheim Docker Container

Iâ€™m currently working on my first Docker Image :) </br>
Alle Credits goes to CM2Walki for his steamcmd Container</br>

# What is Valheim
Valheim. A brutal exploration and survival game for 1-10 players, set in</br> a procedurally-generated purgatory 
inspired by viking culture. Battle, build, and conquer your </br>way to a saga worthy of Odin's patronage!
